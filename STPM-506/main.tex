  \begin{alertblock}{\textbf{SUMMARY}}

An assumption that clinical data are recorded without any error is optimistically made. While some study personnel will record the actual times when there is a deviation others record the nominal time. In the current modeling and simulation work we:
\begin{itemize}
\item[I] Investigate an approach that includes error correction factor on recorded time and quantitate the bias in estimated parameters.
\item[II] Determine the maximal deviation between observed and recorded times that does not cause significant bias.
\item[III] Compare the performance of first-order conditional (FOCE) and stochastic expectation-maximization (SAEM) algorithms in handling data with erroneous recorded times.
\end{itemize}
We conclude that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding a correction factor to the recorded time will lead to diluting the bias and imprecision in PK estimates compared to assuming the recorded time is absolute.
    \item A magnitude difference greater than 5 minutes between the actual and recorded times can lead to more than 10\% bias and imprecise PK estimates.
    \item In comparison between estimation algorithms, SAEM estimates were more accurate than FOCE in primary PK parameters and produced similar RUV estimates on average.
\end{itemize}

Despite the limited settings, we believe this work provides general insight on the ways to handle suspected data with unrecorded time deviations.

  \begin{block}{\textbf{METHODS}}
Two sources of error were modeled in this work: a classical error model and a combined classical and Berkson error (kappa) model. The former is what the pharmacometrician/clinical pharmacologist frequently implements in NLMEM to characterize the errors in observed concentrations. The general structure for the $j^{th}$ subject and $i^{th}$ time point as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
y_{i,j} = f(\Phi, x_i, t_{i,j}) + g(\Phi, x_i, t_{i,j})\epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}
Let us introduce the actual time $T_A$ for the $i^{th}$ concentration in the $j^{th}$ subject as a function of recorded time   $T_R$ and gaussian noise, $\kappa$, that is an independent and identically distributed random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation $K$, representing the deviation of actual time from the recorded time.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:two}
	T_{A,i,j} = T_{R,i,j} + \kappa_{i,j}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the kappa model, $M_\kappa$, can be presented as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:three}
y_{i,j} = f(\Phi, x_i, T_{A,i,j}) + g(\Phi, x_i, T_{A,i,j})\epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}
In order to evaluate if there is a threshold of time deviation that is acceptable, we will be defining $t^*$ in this work to represent the time used in estimation process under parts II-III, where this a mathematical case:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:for}
t^* = \begin{cases} T_A & |T_A - T_R| > \delta \\ T_R & \mathrm{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{equation}

A 500 mg single dose study with 500 in-silico subjects was simulated under a two-compartment first-order absorption and linear elimination model, $f(.)$. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were sampled from a multivariate log-normal distribution with a mean of the logarithmic typical values vector and diagonal variance matrix $\Omega$. A 15\% CV served as a baseline residual unexplained variability (RUV) using a proportional error model $g(.)$. Table \ref{tab:1} presents the true simulated PK parameters with corresponding BSV CV, and RUV magnitude.

Three sample collection designs were examined; (a) Intense design (I) with 8 samples: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours post dose, (b) sparse design (S) with 4 samples: 0.5, 2, 24, 48 hours post dose and (c) mixed design (M) with 33\% of subjects having 8 samples as in I, 33\%  of subjects having 6 samples (0.5, 2, 4, 12, 24, 48), and 33\% of subjects having 4 samples as in S.\par
Two models were created: the null model (Eq \ref{eq:1}; $M_0$), and the kappa model, (Eq \ref{eq:three};  $M_\kappa$), respectively. The model was built with `PRED` subroutine to allow the implementation of kappa model, $M_\kappa$. Parameters were estimated using first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) with interaction between $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ since a proportional error model is used.\par
In part two, simulations were perturbed with a standard deviation of 10 minutes  in time, followed by creating a new column in the dataset presenting the time used in the estimation process as shown in equation (Eq \ref{eq:for}; $t^*$). The difference, $\delta$, was selected to be 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. In fitting the model to the data, $t^*$ was used as the independent variable time with $M_0$.\par
In part three of this study we re-used data generated from the previous section (part II) and repeating the analysis with SAEM algorithms including interaction term. The AUTO=1 criteria was used to select the most suitable convergence test in SAEM, and importance sampling was used to evaluate the likelihood function.
